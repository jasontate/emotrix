# Emotrix

**Emotrix** is a macOS screen saver inspired by *The Matrix* “digital rain” effect, with a twist: real text occasionally emerges from the noise, 
drifting down the screen like fragments of pop-punk song from your youth.

Most of what you see is unreadable glyphs.  
Every so often, something *almost emo* slips through.
